I am completely obsessed
Can't stop thinking like this
Can't resist to feed this darkness in me
I let myself progress
Into nothing but this mess
This is not a life
I can't take no more

I'm so frustrated
I've become so jaded
I've lost my self control (self control)
I feel so far from home
Feel so far from home
So alone
So alone

I will learn to live again
There must be a way
The only one who can save me is me
I'm my own worst enemy
I will find my voice
This hidden strength in me
Try to get away
I used to feel so free

I am ready to face my fears and try to carry on
This is the hardest thing I've known but it's time to move on

I'm so frustrated
I've become so jaded
I've lost my self control (self control)
I feel so far from home
Feel so far from home
So alone
So alone

This is the last time
I'm breaking the habit
This is the last time
I'm breaking the habit
This is the last time
I'm breaking the habit
I'll do what I can to make things right
This is the last time
I'm breaking the habit
I'll do what I can to make things right
Make a stand
This is the last time
I'm breaking the habit
I'll do what I can to make things right
Make a stand
